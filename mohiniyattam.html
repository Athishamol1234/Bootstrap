            Lord Vishnu once came to the aid of the Gods by assuming the form of the beautiful enchantress Mohini to seduce their arch nemesis, the Asuras (demons). He would retrieve the very elixir of life from them, which is said to have appeared when the Ocean of Milk was churned. The temple dancers of old are said to be the first to have started this dance form in commemoration of this great mythological event, and the world was eternally blessed with the captivating classical dance form, Mohiniyattam.

            The leisurely movements, the swaying yet graceful symphony of the hips and eye movements that enchant all who witness them are all synonymous with this legendary art form. Initially called 'Dasiattam' because of the Devdasis (temple dancers) who first performed it, Mohiniyattam was very popular during the Chera reign from 9th to 12th century. Its elegant costume, traditional jewellery and alluring make up aresynonymous with the culture of Kerala. People flock in large numbers from around the world to witnessthischarming performance.
